The Oding project foundation course - project recipe

This is the fist website I've built using CSS and HTML. 

Through this project I was able to practice and learn 
- the basic prinicples of CSS and HTML and truly understand how these two documents work together
- HTML elements, tags and basic structure 
- CSS selectors 
- CSS casacade 
- CSS properties 

An important mistake I've made is forgetting to commit throughout the project. I won't forget it again!
