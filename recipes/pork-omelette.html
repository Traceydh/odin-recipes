                <p class="child"> CHILD PARAGRAPH Thai Omelets are a little like a flat, solid, golden-brown pancake made of egg and other ingredients, rather than the light, fluffy, thin, and barely cooked versions included in western cuisines. Kai Jeow Moo Sap is a type of Thai Omelet where ground pork and other seasonings are cooked inside the whipped egg. This allows the juices and fats from the meat to mix with the raw egg while cooking, creating a juicy and very delicious egg dish that is usually eaten as a side dish with other foods for either breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
                <p class="child"> CHILD PARAGRAPH: In the traditional cooking method a large wok and a generous portion of vegetable oil is used to fry the egg. However, because seed oils are essentially industrial sludge and I don't like poisoning myself, use coconut oil instead. Any other natural saturated fats like lard, butter or olive are also suitable..</p>
